    Takes two datetime objects and returns the time between d and now
    as a nicely formatted string, e.g. "10 minutes".  If d occurs after now,
    then "0 minutes" is returned.

    Units used are years, months, weeks, days, hours, and minutes.
    Seconds and microseconds are ignored.  Up to two adjacent units will be
    displayed.  For example, "2 weeks, 3 days" and "1 year, 3 months" are
    possible outputs, but "2 weeks, 3 hours" and "1 year, 5 days" are not.
